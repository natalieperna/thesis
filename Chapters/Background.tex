%# Inline expansion

%Inline expansion replaces a function call site with the body of the called function

In this chapter, we introduce the necessary compiler theory and logical background concepts required for the understanding of the material presented in the thesis. In Section~\ref{sec:section_one}, we give an introduction to the Agda compiler and the GHC backend. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:background_conclusion}, we conclude with a summary of the core concepts and describe where they are used throughout the remainder of the thesis.

\subsection{Agda}

Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language.

%The Agda package: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Agda

% Include an Agda tutorial as per: http://dspace.library.uu.nl:8080/handle/1874/256628
% or is it necessary to understand thesis?

The core syntax of Agda is a dependently typed lambda calculus, with a simple grammar as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:grammar}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{align*}
a ::=~& x               & \text{variable}\\
    |~& \lambda x \to a & \text{abstraction}\\
    |~& a~a             & \text{application}\\
    |~& (x : a) \to a   & \text{function space}\\
    |~& Set[n]          & \text{universe}\\
    |~& (a)             & \text{grouping}
\end{align*}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Compiler}

The Agda programming language's first and most-used backend is MAlonzo, or more generically, the GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) backend.\cite{benke2007} Given an Adga module containig a \lstinline{main} function, the Agda \texttt{--compile} option will compile the program using the GHC backend, which translates an Agda program into Haskell source. The generated Haskell source can then be automatically or manually (with \texttt{--ghc-dont-call-ghc}) compiled to an executable program via GHC.\cite{agdadocs} % http://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/compilers.html

Though there are several stages of translation and compilation in this process, the transition of primiary interest for our optimization is the conversion of compiled clauses to a ``treeless'' syntax, after Agda type-checking, but before Haskell source is generated.

Agda functions are implemented by giving both a type and a definition. Functions on datatypes can be defined by pattern matching on the constructors of that datatype, describing structurally recursive functions.\cite{agdawiki} % http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/agda.php?n=Docs.DatatypeAndFunctionDefinitions
Because function definitions in Agda are written as a series of one or more pattern matching clauses on possible variable inputs, we can construct an equivalent definition via case tree.\cite{agdawiki} % http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/agda.php?n=Docs.PatternMatching
Compiled clauses are, simply put, case trees.

This should sound familiar to users of functional programming languages like Haskell. Unlike Haskell, however, Agda does not permit partial functions. Therefore, functions defined by pattern matching must not exclude any possible cases from the pattern matching clauses.\cite{agdawiki} % http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=ReferenceManual.Totality#Coveragechecking}
Once coverage checking is completed, pattern matching can be translated into case trees by successively splitting on each variable.\cite{agdahackage} % https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Agda-2.5.2/docs/Agda-TypeChecking-CompiledClause.html
% TODO Take for example the following case tree equivalence for a foo function, defined by pattern matching, in Agda: ??? \cite{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Agda-2.5.2/docs/Agda-TypeChecking-CompiledClause.html}

%Compiled clauses are case trees with their bodies.
%Document compiled clauses: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Agda-2.5.2/docs/Agda-TypeChecking-CompiledClause.html

The treeless syntax is the input to the compiler backend of Agda. After all type-checking is complete, the higher-level internal syntax of compiled clauses is translated to a ``treeless'' syntax, the name for which is derived from its use of case expressions instead of case trees. The other notable difference between compiled clauses and treeless syntax is the absence of datatypes and constructors.\cite{agdahackage} %TODO WHY? % https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Agda-2.5.2/docs/Agda-Syntax-Treeless.html

\subsection{Agda Module System}
% Either before or after compiler section
% Discuss Agda module system and its translation
% Arguments inheited from all enclosing modules

\subsection{Lambda Calculus}

The treeless syntax is constructed from \lstinline{TTerm}s %TODO What does the T stand for?
and is a representation of the abstract syntax tree for the compiler backend. It can be reasoned about as a lambda calculus with all local variable using de Bruijn indices. A listing of \lstinline{TTerm} constructors is shown in Figure~\ref{code:TTerm}.

In this section we examine the constructors of \lstinline{TTerm}s one-by-one\cite{agdahackage}, then discuss how substitutions can be safely performed on \lstinline{TTerm}s as a preface for discussing our optimizations.

% TODO Read about how sharing is lost with substitution in the agda mailing list: https://lists.chalmers.se/pipermail/agda/2017/009379.html

% TODO present de bruijn indices

A \textbf{\lstinline{TVar}} is a de Bruijn indexed variable term.

A \textbf{\lstinline{TPrim}} is a compiler-related primitive, such as addition, subtraction and equality on some primitive types.

A \textbf{\lstinline{TDef}} is a qualified name identifying a function or datatype definition % TODO confirm

A \textbf{\lstinline{TApp}} is a \lstinline{TTerm} applied to a list of arguments, where each argument is itself a \lstinline{TTerm}.

A \textbf{\lstinline{TLam}} % TTerm

A \textbf{\lstinline{TLit}} % Literal

A \textbf{\lstinline{TCon}} % QName

A \textbf{\lstinline{TLet}} introduces a new local term binding in a term body.           

A \textbf{\lstinline{TCase}} is a case expression on a case scrutinee (always a de Bruijn indexed variable), a case type, a default value and a list of alternatives.

The case alternatives, \textbf{\lstinline{TAlt}}s, may be constructed from:
\begin{itemize}
\item a \lstinline{TACon}, which matches on a constructor of a given qualified name, biding the appropriate number of pattern variables to the body term if a match is made. Note that a \lstinline{TCase}'s list of \lstinline{Args} must have unique qualified names for each \lstinline{TACon}.
\item a \lstinline{TAGuard}, which matches on a boolean guard and binds no variables if matched against.
\item a \lstinline{TALit}, which matches on a literal term.
\end{itemize}
          
A \textbf{\lstinline{TUnit}} is used for levels. % TODO what does that mean

A \textbf{\lstinline{TSort}}

A \textbf{\lstinline{TErased}}

A \textbf{\lstinline{TError}} is used to indicate a runtime error.

% substitutions aren't part of the lambda calculus syntax, that's why this isn't a lambda-sigma-calculus

% here we do substitution as a function on terms

%explicit subst is when applysubst is a term constructor (which obviously it isn't here)
