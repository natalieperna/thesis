In this chapter, we discuss various aspects of the problem of XYZ. In Section~\ref{sec:discussion}, we discuss some possible application domains for which the XYZ technique presented in Chapter~\ref{cha:main_chapter} is suitable. We also discuss the importance of such techniques and applications. In Section~\ref{sec:assessment_of_the_contributions}, we assess the strengths and weaknesses of the main contributions.

In this section, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the main contributions presented in this thesis. It is important to highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of the models and techniques that are developed so that we are able to further refine a solution to the problem of XYZ and possibly one day eliminate their use completely.
