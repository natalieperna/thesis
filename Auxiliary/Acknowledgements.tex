Thank you to Dr. Kahl, whose patience and guidance has helped me grow intellectually, both as an undergraduate and graduate student. I am truly grateful for my time learning from him.

Thank you also to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) for the financial support that made my graduate studies possible.

Lastly, thank you to all of my family, friends, and loved ones, for their support and encouragement, especially my fianc\'{e}, Max.
