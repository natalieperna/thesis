	Abstract = {Information algebras represent a structure which captures essential features of any concept of "information". The presentation here focuses on its basic theory. There are many more aspects: One is computation: How are pieces of information combined and focussed on the domains of interest? This is the problem of query processing where local computation methods can be applied. A lot of work has been done with respect to this problem. In particular domains like query processing in relational algebra, solving linear equations, for instance in coding theory, consequence finding in logic, etc have been studied extensively. Whereas each of these domains has its particularities which can and must be explored, information algebra offers a common background on which generic methods can be developed. In this respect we refer to [M. Pouly, 2006] which describes a generic software for local computation, permitting instantiations with any information (or rather valuation) algebra.},

	Abstract = {Analyzing information flow is beneficial on ensuring the satisfiability of security policies during the exchange of information between the agents of a system. In the literature, models such as Bell-LaPadula model and the Chinese Wall model are proposed to capture and govern the exchange of information among agents. Also, we find several verification techniques for analyzing information flow within programs or multi-agent systems. However, these models and techniques assume the atomicity of the exchanged information; that is the information cannot be decomposed or combined with other pieces of information. Also, their policies prohibits any transfer of information from a high level agent to a low level agent. In this report, we propose a technique that relaxes these assumptions. Indeed, the proposed technique allows classifying information into frames and articulating finer granularity policies that involve information, its elements, or its frames. It allows as well information manipulation through several operations such as focusing and combining information. Relaxing the atomicity of information assumption permits an analysis that takes into account the ability of an agent to link elements of information in order to evolve its knowledge. 
The technique uses global calculus to specify the communication between agents, information algebra to represent agent knowledge, and an amended version of Hoare logic to verify the satisfiability of policies.},

	Abstract = {Cryptographic protocols are widely used in various applications to provide secure communications. They are usually represented as communicating agents that send and receive messages. These agents use their knowledge to exchange information and communicate with other agents involved in the protocol. An agent knowledge can be partitioned into explicit knowledge and procedural knowledge. The explicit knowledge refers to the set of information which is either proper to the agent or directly obtained from other agents through communication. The procedural knowledge relates to the set of mechanisms used to get new information from what is already available to the agent.
In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework which specifies the explicit knowledge of an agent involved in a cryptographic protocol. Modelling this knowledge is crucial for the specification, analysis, and implementation of cryptographic protocols. We also, report on a prototype tool that allows the representation and the manipulation of the explicit knowledge.},

	Abstract = {Covert channels have been known since a long time and under various forms. Methods used by designers to exchange information with discretion depend mainly on their creativity. These streams of data are so stealthy that they can be easily used by some dishonest persons or malwares. In an (supposed) other world, the virtualization of operating systems has brought a higher flexibility in the deployment of server farms and shared hosting. It also brings hopes concerning security through partitioning. These two subjects are not so obviously linked, but for each form of new technologie we need to think about past errors to be able to bypass them before they come up. The designer may not know all threats, and new exploitation techniques can appear, more or less planned. In this context, this article explains technologies used by the Xen paravirtualizer about memory management and virtual guests. Thereafter, it explains how to exploit this mechanism to reach a new method of covert channel for virtual machines. Finally, experimental results show that the proof of concept can stealthily transfer data between virtual machines.},

	Abstract = {Golomb analyzed the Z-channel, a memoryless channel with two input symbols and two output symbols, where one of the input symbols is transmitted with noise while the other is transmitted without noise, and the output symbol transmission times are equal. We generalize to the timed Z-channel, where the output symbol transmission times are not equal. The timed Z-channel appears as the basis for a large class of covert (communication) channels appearing in multilevel secure computer systems. We give a detailed mathematical analysis of the timed Z-channel and report a result expressing the capacity of the timed Z-channel as the log of the root of a characteristic equation. This generalizes Shannon's work on noiseless channels for this special case. We also report a new result bounding the timed Z-channel's capacity from below. We show how an interesting observation that Golomb reported for the Z-channel also holds for the timed Z-channel},

	Abstract = {The exploration of advanced covert timing channel design is important to understand and defend against covert timing channels. In this paper, we introduce a new class of covert timing channels, called model-based covert timing channels, which exploit the statistical properties of legitimate network traffic to evade detection in an effective manner. We design and implement an automated framework for building model-based covert timing channels. Our framework consists of four main components: filter, analyzer, encoder, and transmitter. The filter characterizes the features of legitimate network traffic, and the analyzer fits the observed traffic behavior to a model. Then, the encoder and transmitter use the model to generate covert traffic and blend with legitimate network traffic. The framework is lightweight, and the overhead induced by model fitting is negligible. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conduct a series of experiments in LAN and WAN environments. The experimental results show that model-based covert timing channels provide a significant increase in detection resistance with only a minor loss in capacity.},

	Abstract = {A covert channel can occur when an attacker finds and exploits a shared resource that is not designed to be a communication mechanism. A network covert channel operates by altering the timing of otherwise legitimate network traffic so that the arrival times of packets encode confidential data that an attacker wants to exfiltrate from a secure area from which she has no other means of communication. In this article, we present the first public implementation of an IP covert channel, discuss the subtle issues that arose in its design, and present a discussion on its efficacy. We then show that an IP covert channel can be differentiated from legitimate channels and present new detection measures that provide detection rates over 95%. We next take the simple step an attacker would of adding noise to the channel to attempt to conceal the covert communication. For these noisy IP covert timing channels, we show that our online detection measures can fail to identify the covert channel for noise levels higher than 10%. We then provide effective offline search mechanisms that identify the noisy channels.},

	Abstract = {In spite of a relatively large number of publications about breaking Enigma by the allies before and during the World War II, this subject remains relatively unknown not only to the general public, but also to people professionally involved in cryptological research. For example, the story of Enigma is rarely a part of a modern textbook on cryptology or a modern course on cryptography and network security. There exist multiple reasons for this situation. First, there are still a few unresolved issues, resulting from conflicting reports, the lack of reliable sources, and a long period required for declassifying documents related to any cryptological activity during the World War II. Secondly, the issue is highly political, and there is little consensus in weighing the contribution of all involved countries. Thirdly, many contemporary cryptologists honestly believe that there is little to learn from the analysis of old cryptosystems, because of the tremendous progress in theory and practice of cryptography and a little similarity between old and modern ciphers. In this paper we confront these opinions by presenting a look at the current state of knowledge about cryptological methods and devices used to break Enigma. We introduce all major players involved in these activities, and we make an effort to weigh their original contributions. Finally, we show that the story of Enigma can still provide contemporary cryptographers with many useful lessons regarding the way of organizing and building any large-scale security system},

ACM 26 (8) (1983) 572--581; Parnas and Madey, Sci. Comput. Programm. 25 (1) (1995) 41--61; Parnas et al., IEEE Trans. Software Eng. 20 (12) (1994) 948--976) advocate the use of relational model for documenting the intended behaviour of programs. In this method, tabular expressions (or tables) are used to improve readability so that formal documentation can replace conventional documentation. Parnas (CRL Report 260, Telecommunications Research Institute of Ontario (TRIO), Mcmaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, 1992) describes several classes of tables and provides their formal syntax and semantics. In this paper, an alternative, more general and more homogeneous semantics is proposed. The model covers all known types of tables used in Software Engineering.},

Recently, the increased interest in fuzzy relations has fostered a lot of work concerning relation-like structures with weaker axiomatisations.
In this paper, we study symmetric quotients in such settings and provide many new proofs for properties previously only shown in the strong theory of heterogeneous relation algebras. Thus we hope to make both the weaker axiomatisations and the many applications of symmetric quotients more accessible to people working on problems in some specific part of the wide spectrum of relation categories.},

	Abstract = {A forensic investigation of digital evidence is commonly employed as a post-event response to a serious information security incident. In fact, there are many circumstances where an organisation may benefit from an ability to gather and preserve digital evidence before an incident occurs. Forensic readiness is defined as the ability of an organisation to maximise its potential to use digital evidence whilst minimising the costs of an investigation. The costs and benefits of such an approach are outlined. Preparation to use digital evidence may involve enhanced system and staff monitoring, technical, physical and procedural means to secure data to evidential standards of admissibility, processes and procedures to ensure that staff recognise the importance and legal sensitivities of evidence, and appropriate legal advice and interfacing with law enforcement. This paper proposes a ten step process for an organisation to implement forensic readiness.},
	Annote = {- In a business context however, there is the opportunity to actively collect potential evidence in the form of logfiles, emails, back-up disks, portable computers, network traffic records, and telephone records, amongst others.
- Being prepared to gather and use evidence can also have benefit as a deterrent.
- The following ten steps describe the key activities in implementing a forensic readiness programme.
1. Define the business scenarios that require digital evidence.
2. Identify available sources and different types of potential evidence.
3. Determine the evidence collection requirement.
4. Establish a capability for securely gathering legally admissible evidence to meet the requirement.
5. Establish a policy for secure storage and handling of potential evidence.
6. Ensure monitoring is targeted to detect and deter major incidents.
7. Specify circumstances when escalation to a full formal investigation (which may use the digital evidence) should be launched.
8. Train staff in incident awareness, so that all those involved understand their role in the digital evidence process and the legal sensitivities of evidence.
9. Document an evidence-based case describing the incident and its impact.
10. Ensure legal review to facilitate action in response to the incident.},

	Annote = {- Today some organizations are following Los Alamos's precedent and routinely recording some or all of the traffic on their external Internet connections. 
- Little of this information is actually analyzed. Instead, it is collected in expectation that it might be useful at some future point.
- Capturing everything moving over the network is simple in theory, but relatively complex in practice.
- Another approach to monitoring is to examine all of the traffic that moves over the network, but only record information deemed worthy of further analysis.
- Ranum coined the term "Network Forensics" back in 1997.
- "Catch it as you can" systems immediately write the packets to a disk file, buffering in memory as necessary, and perform analysis in batches.
- As a result, these systems need exceptionally large disks -- ideally RAID systems.
-  "Stop, look and listen" systems analyze the packets in memory, perform rudimentary data analysis and reduction, and write selected results to disk or to a database over the network. 
- How much attention you need to give the hardware you use for network monitoring depends to a large extent on the complexity of your network, the amount of data at the points you wish to monitor, and how good a job you want to do.
- If you are trying to make extended recordings of every packet that goes over a fully-loaded gigabit link, you will find it quite a challenge to build a suitable capture platform and disk farm.
- Over the six operating systems tested, FreeBSD had the best capture performance and Windows NT had the worst. 
- In a world in which strong encryption was ubiquitous, the monitoring performed by these network forensics systems would be restricted to what's called "traffic analysis" -- every IP packet contains the address of its destination and the address of its sender. 
- By examining the flow of packets over time, it's possible to infer when a person is working, who they are communicating with, what Web sites they are visiting, and other sorts of tantalizingly vague information.
- Using a network forensics tool you can spy on people's email, learn passwords, determine Web pages viewed, even spy on the contents of a person's shopping cart at Amazon.com.
- The tremendous power these systems have over today's networks makes them subject to abuse.
- If you install a monitoring system, you should have a policy regarding who has access to use the system, under what circumstances it should be used, and what can be done with the information collected.
- This vulnerability to covert monitoring is a fundamental property of most communications systems, including telegraph wires, long-range microwave links, and even semaphore.
- But while monitoring was always possible in a networked environment, NFAT tools make monitoring considerably easier than ever before.
- The power of these tools is their ability to rapidly distill down a large data set into manageable chunks.
- As such, these systems are a double-edged sword for security and privacy.
- Rather than record the contents of every TCP/IP connection, which would have subjected Harvard's entire community to unacceptable monitoring, the FBI used a program called I-Watch (developed by the Automated Systems Security Incident Support Team at the Defense Information Systems Agency in Washington, D.C.) that could be programmed to only capture TCP/IP connections that contained a particular keyword.
- From a legal point of view, your right to monitor (or to be free from monitoring) depends on who you are, where you are working, and who is doing the monitoring. 
- Corporations generally have free rein to monitor their own networks, provided that employees and network users are told in advance that the monitoring may be taking place.},

	Abstract = {The exponential growth of the Internet (WWW in particular) has opened-up several avenues for covert channel communication. Steganographic communication is one such avenue. Hiding secret messages in digital data such as images using steganographic software tools is becoming easier. These digital images posted in public Web sites can then be downloaded at the receiver and the hidden messages may be extracted securely. To thwart covert channels on the Internet new types of search engines that can identify, detect and track these channels are necessary. Traditional search algorithms will fail to identify these channels. In this paper, we discuss various key issues involved in developing a stego (forensic) Web search engine. We also propose approaches to address some of these issues. Finally, we discuss a prototype forensic search engine that we developed called STEALTH and discuss in detail its architecture. Some experimental results are also reported.},
	Annote = {- The exponential growth of the Internet (WWW in particular) has opened-up several avenues for covert channel communication.
- A covert channel is any communication channel that can be exploited by a process to transfer information in a manner that violates the system security policy.
- Covert channel is a simple yet very effective mechanism for sending and receiving information between two parties on a network without triggering any firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS) on the network. 
- Covert channels bypass traditional security mechanisms by hiding information in seemingly benign data (e.g., control fields in the TCP and IP headers, digital images etc.).
- Steganography (stego) is an example of a storage channel.
- Some of the key questions we identify are the following:
	- Where to look: How to identify Web links that could potentially contain covert messages?
	- What are the fundamental design issues in developing a forensic search engine?
	- How to look: How to exploit network traffic to detect stego Web pages?
	- Exploiting side information: Message carrying Web sites may have not a public link. Then how to exploit side information such as http traffic request in the back bone to identify these hidden links?
	- Time scale: Stego Web pages may be created, moved and destroyed randomly on a daily basis; short-lived Web pages.
	- Scalability: A Web-page like e-bay could contain thousands of multimedia files, i.e., images, audio, etc. What are the efficient search techniques to employ?
	- Steganalysis: How do we integrate steganalysis with forensic Web search?
- The Web is becoming more and more complex while its size continues to grow at remarkable rate with an estimated 7 million new pages being created every day.
- The hidden Web: Detecting covert communication on some password protected forum and other service provider sites is a critical issue.
- We use Ethereal packet sniffer for tracking http requests on the backbone network. 
- Ethereal is a freeware software released under GNU general public license. It allows live data to be captured and read in Ethernet, FDDI, PPP, Token-Ring, IEEE 802.11, classical IP over ATM, loop back interfaces, etc.
- We are further developing the different modules within STEALTH. 
- We expect to run extensive experiments on our university's main router. 
- We are also investigating other potential covert channels such as e-mail, FTP, and peer-to-peer communication.},

	Annote = {- To-date, security analysis techniques focus on the explicit access to data, thereby neglecting information flows happening over covert channels.
- Generally, a software application must comply with security policies.
- Their enforcement relies on secure design methodologies and on reference monitors. 
- While these enforcement mechanisms can effectively prevent illicit accesses to data, e.g. when user A illegally requests access rights to object X, they can neither control nor recognize the so-called covert channels.
- Covert channels, such as timing channels and implicit flows, can lead to unintended information flows (IF) and, eventually, policy violations.
- The idea of IFF proposes the a-posteriori detection of IF through inspection of authentic log data, thereby making IF analysis an audit task. 
- Clearly, forensic analysis cannot prevent illicit flows. 
- However, it enables their timely recognition and the initiation of countermeasures.
- At the heart of IFF is the (``intelligent'') analysis of log data collected during the software execution.
- The upper half of the figure shows the more subtle, ``indirect'' transfers through observation and inference. 
- These transfers are called information flows, or simply IF.
- While IF is largely neglected when software is written and deployed, it poses a grand threat for the confidentiality of sensitive data in most applications.
- For instance, by exploiting the fact that the response times of many applications differ significantly depending on whether a provided username is valid or not, it is possible to verify the existence of account names.
- Usual ways to express IF properties are those specifying the entropy of data, as well as the Biba policy and the various ways of expressing IF policies based on the original notion of noninterference.
- Static enforcement of IF requires to specify the target system in a tool-specific notation (such as a special programming language or the description logic of a theorem prover) and yields the decision whether the system respects a given policy or not. 
- This approach is feasible only for niche applications, but is in most cases impractical for the following reasons:
	- Inflexibility of policies. 	
 	- Implementation-dependent IF. 
	- Existence of legacy software. 
	- Lacking modularity.
- To complement static IF analysis, we investigate the a posteriori detection of IF in a manner similar to forensic investigations.
- We currently investigate the following issues:
	- A system model for forensic analysis.
	- Data selection.
	- Development of analysis algorithms.
- Other issues that remain to be investigated include the selection of log data to feed the analysis engine and the certainty of generated evidence -- are there false negatives or positives? --, which is much a function of the underlying analysis technique.},

	Abstract = {Today log traces are widely used to identify and prevent violations of corporate information systems. The most recent logging trend is to manage most level 3 ISO/OSI traffic via pcap-compatible output. But use of syslog is still very widespread, as are the security issues it entails, especially in its `pure' version. This paper outlines the basic syslog problems as foreseen in the RFCs, examines the `secure' alternatives to the protocol (and relative implementations) and proposes a transmission approach based on covert channels which, applied on the LINUX platform, might answer some of the intrinsic reliability problems which undermine its effectiveness as a digital forensic tool},
	Address = {Los Alamitos, CA, USA},
	Annote = {- Syslog is unquestionably the most widely used and accepted standard for logging system information.
- Despite its popularity and widespread use, the syslog protocol is intrinsically unsecure.
- Syslog relies on UDP to transmit messages.
- A second intrinsic problem with the protocol is that it does not provide, except at the IP packet level, any mechanism to safeguard the integrity of the message produced.
- Finally, there is no mechanism to verify the source of the messages.
- Once collected, syslog data must be stored safely to be used as proof in any investigation of a system violation. 
- However forensic analysis requires that the proof, i.e. the logs, satisfies the following criteria:
	- Admissible: they must conform with certain legal requisites to be valid in court;
	- Authentic: it must be possible to prove that the logs contain evidence of the incident in question;
	- Complete: the logs must represent the entire history of the incident and not just a part;	- Trusted: there must be no doubts about how the data was collected, its authenticity and its subsequent movements ;	- Credible: they must be easily understandable in court.
- The commonly accepted definition states that a covert channel is any communications channel which can be used to transmit information using methods that violate existing security policies.
- Covert channels can be divided into two main categories: storage channels and timing channels. 
- Their purpose is basically the same; they differ only in how the information is made available.
- In this case the only field that can be used to set up a covert channel that is not easy to detect is the Identification field.
- The header of the TCP protocol provides several possibilities, but again the covert channel must be difficult to detect and the best field to use for this is the SN (Sequence Number) field.
- A brief example of traffic received by Tcpdump showing how the text string (``MICKEY'') can be transmitted to a Web server. 
- The decoding algorithm subtracts one from the ID field and then performs Mod 256 to obtain the original ASCII value.
- A correctly configured router/firewall should not allow a packet with the ACK flag active to pass, if it does not recognize that the destination host is responsible for opening the connection.
- HTTP-based covert channels can therefore take many forms, making the protocol the ideal vehicle for anyone wishing to hide illicit traffic.
- We should just mention NSTX and note that rumors abound that botnets and other malignant code may be able to exploit DNS servers to exchange clandestine data.
- Such considerations explain why sending logs with SecSyslog via a covert channel is so powerful, and why DNS tunneling provides an excellent solution to the problem.},

It addresses the need for dedicated investigative capabilities in the current model to allow investigating malicious behavior in networks. It helps organizations in investigating outside and inside network attacks. It is also important for law enforcement investigations. In this paper, various aspects of network forensics are reviewed as well as related technologies and their limitations. Also, challenges in deploying a network forensics infrastructure are highlighted.},

	Annote = {- Generally, these products addresses security from two main perspectives; namely prevention and detection. 
- Examples of prevention products include firewalls and access control mechanisms. 
- Similarly, examples of detection products include intrusion detection systems and antivirus tools.
- In computer security literature, network forensics has been proposed to introduce investigation capabilities in current networks. 
- It refers to a dedicated investigation infrastructure that allows for the collection and analysis of network packets and events for investigative purposes.
- Network Forensics: The use of scientifically proved techniques to collect, fuse, identify, examine, correlate, analyze, and document digital evidence from multiple, actively processing and transmitting digital sources for the purpose of uncovering facts related to the planned intent, or measured success of unauthorized activities meant to disrupt, corrupt, and or compromise system components as well as providing information to assist in response to or recovery from these activities.
- In theory, digital forensics (and hence network forensics) is not a protection product.
- In particular, it is not supposed to replace firewalls and intrusion detection systems. 
- Instead, it is a complex process in which methodologies, tools and human intelligence combine for the purpose of investigation.
- Readiness phases: The goal of these phases is to ensure that the personal and infrastructure are able to fully support an investigation when an incident occurs.
- Deployment phases: The goal of these phases is to provide a mechanism for an incident to be detected and confirmed.
- Physical Crime Scene Investigation phases : The goal of these phases is to collect and analyze the physical evidence and reconstruct the actions that took place during the incident.
- Digital Crime Scene Investigation phases : The goal of these phases is to analyze digital devices that were obtained from the physical investigation phases.
- Review phases: The goal ofthese phases is to review the whole investigation and identify areas of improvement.
- Network forensics is currently a manual and time consuming process.
- A false-positive refers to the case when an IDS generates an alert for a nonexistent attack, while a false-negative refers to the case when an IDS misses an actual attack.
- The forensics process usually follows well defined procedures to preserve, identify, extract, document, and interpret recovered data in the seized computer.},

	Abstract = {Computer forensic investigators rely on high quality evidence to win a case. Logs, authentication information, date and timestamps, file contents and other electronic data all need to be proven to be reliable in court. But what happens when criminals are actively trying to ruin the evidence? ANTI Forensic techniques are now being used to skew evidence and make it impossible for an examiner to use. According to Brian Sartin at ISACA, ANTI forensics is used in two-thirds of all data compromise investigations carried out by his organization. Examiners need to be on the look out for three methods of distorting evidence: Data Obfuscation, Data Hiding and Zero-footprinting. Almost every case will use some form of data obfuscation that involves a hacker erasing his tracks. But Data hiding draws on the power of cryptography to mask data rather than delete it The use of steganography is another data hiding approach. Examiners need to actively search for evidence of the use of ANTI-forensic techniques. Computer Forensics (CF), as we know it, is in a volatile state. Newer and more sophisticated investigative challenges, both existing and on the horizon, are forcing CF to evolve as a practice. As such, the processes, the technologies, and the tools of the trade that characterise the conventional CF approach have changed. Simply put, CF today is not what it used to be and there are some very simple reasons why. &copy; 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
	Annote = {- Newer and more sophisticated investigative challenges, both existing and on the horizon, are forcing CF to evolve as a practice.
- The year 2005 has been referred to as the year of Data Compromise.
- Internationally, the law enforcement community has become very effective in identifying and apprehending the sources of these security breaches, as well as the fraudsters making use of the stolen data.
- Hackers are after data they can easily convert into cash. 
- The increasing number of reported data compromises internationally underscores the fact that the information black market is bigger than ever, continually fueling the upward trend in data compromise events.
- Anti-Forensics (AF) refers to the practice of trying to negatively affect the integrity of the digital evidence comprising the CF crime scene.
- Digital evidence, for CF purposes, refers to the log data, authentication information, date & timestamps, file system contents, and the like.
- AF purposefully corrupts the crime scene and can effectively prohibit a forensics examiner from accurately identifying the source of a security breach, preventing containment, and extending exposure.
- Whilst there is no commonly accepted standard in the way of terminology or practice in this area, there are at least three general categories of Anti-Forensics to be concerned with as an examiner: Data Obfuscation, Data Hiding, and Zero Footprinting.
- Data Obfuscation refers to any attempt to cover a hacker's tracks by deleting or otherwise destroying digital evidence.
- Almost every case will involve some form of data obfuscation.
- Logs, authentication information, date and timestamps, file contents and other electronic data all need to be proven to be reliable in court.
- Instead of attempting to destroy any evidence of a security breach, Data Hiding looks to mask it.
- Within AF, data encryption is found in two forms: encryption of data at-rest and data intransit.
- Steganography is designed expressly for the purpose of packing data files into images or pictures.
- Zero-
Footprinting refers to a program that is used to clean areas of the disk in order to completely destroy the original contents, rendering them undetectable.
- Finding ways that data has been purposely hidden from you is now a necessary part of the equation and not something that often happens by mistake.},

	Annote = {- Hiding data in various media with steganographic effects is a good way to covert communication.
- Recently, there are more and more investigations on uses of various types of documents for data hiding, including HTML, Word, and PowerPoint files.
- A message is regarded as a string of bits or characters, and encoded with a special ASCII code by binary or unitary coding. 
- The encoding results are then embedded at the between-word or between-character locations in the text part of a cover PDF file.
- Each PDF file contains a complete description of a 2-D document, which includes text, fonts, images, and vector graphics described by a context-free grammar modified from PostScript.
- It is found in this study that the ASCII code A0 (used as a non-breaking space), when embedded in a string of text characters, become invisible in the windows of several versions of the popular PDF reader, Adobe Reader, under the Windows OS environment.
- So A0 and 20 may be used in a PDF text alternatively as a between-word space to encode a message bit b according to the following binary coding technique:
	- if b = 1; then replace 20 between two words by A0;
	- if b = 0; make nochange
- We will call such a binary coding rule alternative space coding, and call 20 and A0 both as spacing codes in the sequel.
- The other type of invisibility is created by setting the width of the ASCII code A0 to be zero in a PDF page.
- Then after being inserted between two characters, an A0 appears to be nothing in a PDF reader's window just like nonexistent, as found in this study.
- So,when A0 is used as a null code, the space code 20 cannot be used symmetrically to implement a binary coding 
- But we may still use A0 to hide a message character C by a technique of unitary coding at a between-character location L in the following way:
	- if the index of C as specified in Table1is m, then embed m consecutive A0's at L
which will be called null space coding.},

	Abstract = {The concept of covert channels has been visited frequently by academia in a quest to analyse their occurrence and prevention in trusted systems. This has lead to a wide variety of approaches being developed to prevent and identify such channels and implement applicable countermeasures. However, little of this research has actually trickled down into the field of operational security management and risk analysis. Quite recently a number of covert channels and enabling tools have appeared that did have a significant impact on the operational security of organizations. This paper identifies a number of those channels and shows the relative ease with which new ones can be devised. It identifies how risk management processes do not take this upcoming threat into account
and suggests where improvements would be helpful.},
	Annote = {- Covert channels have always proven useful in warfare. 
- One of the first instances of their use can be found in Homer's Odyssey.
- Data smuggling: Covert channels can occur that are exploited with as primary goal to smuggle data into or out of a computer network, in which this data is not supposed to leave or enter that network according to the organizational security policy.
- Automated code execution: Covert channels can occur and be exploited with as primary goal to allow for the transfer into, and execution of code within the recipient system that should not normally be executed by the organizational security policy.
- IP Header Tunnelling was one of the first instances of network level covert channels.
- With this variety comes the risk of them being used to traffic data instead of managing network flows. 
- By compressing data to a form that can be embedded in one such header, data can be transferred between networks covertly. 
- While the headers are open to inspection, the embedded value is legitimate and not considered malicious.
- The DNS protocol underlies the conversion of hostnames into IP addresses on the internet, and as such is a requirement for most computer networks.
- Only one protocol was allowed from the internal network to the internet, being the HTTP protocol required for web browsing. 
- All this traffic was however passed through a proxy server to allow for antivirus and some content scanning. 
- Most likely the common HTTP tunnelling technique would have been successful, being the trafficking of data in the actual HTTP request string.
- Each of the above techniques specifically provides a way to piggyback information onto an existing protocol. 
- An even more advanced way of tunnelling information is by covertly encoding it in benign data, legitimately transferred over existing protocols.
- Covert channels perhaps best compare to the physical act of smuggling. 
- Risk management approaches to smuggling are often based on probabilistic risk management, the measurement of the probability of an incident taking place based on intelligence gathered on the risk level, our current system state and our adversaries.
- Millen (1999, p. 114) stated ``the one question that everyone asks about covert channels is whether they are a real
threat''.
- As long as there are sufficient `open channels' through which confidential information can leak from an organization, the capability to transfer data from a trusted network to an untrusted one may not be a significant issue. 
- However, with increased measures being implemented to counter the more obvious issues -- such as the free transfer of USB sticks in- and out of an organization, use of computer based covert channels is certain to rise.},

	Annote = {- Information and communication dissimulation is not a new topic.
- This can be a good thing if covert channels are used to protect privacy or increase security of critical communication. 
- However when applied to security policy bypassing, information leak or compromised system control the knowledge of such techniques becomes mandatory to enhance detection engine.
- Storage Channels : the most basic indeed, based on the used of a shared data storage area. Most evolved techniques rely on locks or semaphores which positioning may be a piece of information such as a 1 when no lock means 0.
- Timing Channels : the time needed by a process to perform an operation can be voluntarily manipulated to provide information to another process.
- Termination Channels : a process launches a task. It this task is finished at a specified time it means 1, 0 otherwise.
- Resource Exhaustion Channels : the value (0 or 1) is provided by the availability of a specific resource which may be filled up (hard disk), overloaded (100% cpu), etc.
- Power Channels : in this case the information is based on power consumption.
- In 1984 Simmons introduces the concept of subliminal channel through steganography.
- It clearly appears that Covert Channels are deeply linked to the security policy.
- Capacity : this is the quantity of information that can be transmitted through the channel;
- Noise : is the amount of perturbations that can interfere with the information while it is transmitted trough the channel;
- Transmission Mode : can be synchronous when the information is received and managed on the fly by the destination entity, or asynchronous otherwise
- Other fields should be used as long as they meet the following requirements :
- There value can be set at will as long as it remains legitimate;
- The spectrum of possible values must be the largest as possible in order to increase the capacity of the channel.
- They must not be systematically and randomly modified during transmission (as dynamic NAT would do with TCP source port).
- Bouncing techniques take advantage of a third party equipment that will relay the information between the source and the destination. 
- Moreover the bouncing host is not necessarily aware of this and can be changed for each packet, making filtering operations almost impossible.
- SYN/ACK Bounce: Computer A (10.0.0.1) wants to communicate with computer B (192.168.0.1) by bouncing on the server C (www.bounce.com) in order to transmit the following message service ssh start\n, which is 18 bytes long and encoded in hexadecimal (\73\65\72\76\69\63\65\20\73\73\68\20\73\74\61\72\74\0A). 
- Using sequence numbers (4 bytes), this message will be divided in 5 blocks : sequence 1 : 0x73657276, sequence 2 : 0x69636520, sequence 3 : 0x73736820, sequence 4 : 0x73746172, sequence 5 : 0x740A0000 - two null bytes have been used for padding.
- In order to establish the channel, 5 SYNs have to be sent to server C on port 80, with B (192.168.0.1) as a source address and with the sequence numbers that have been calculated before. C will then send the SYN/ACKs to the spoofed source (B). 
- In these SYN/ACK packets the acknowledgement sequence numbers will be respectively 0x73657277, 0x69636521, 0x73736821, 0x73746173 and 0x740A0001, which are the previous sequence numbers sent by A and increased by 1. 
- Reassembly on the other side of the channel is then trivial.
- ICMP Error Bounce: The first use of this mechanism is obvious for computer A and B willing to establish a covert channel thanks to C :
1. A sends a packet that will generate an error. The source of this packet is spoofed to be B. Data to be transmitted can be either in the UDP header or in the first 48 bytes of the UDP data.
2. C identifies the error and sends the appropriate ICMP message to the source : B
3. B receives the packet and gets the data.
- Bouncing techniques can be enhanced thanks to a simple multiplexing technique. 
- The objective is not to use 1 but n bounce servers.},

	Abstract = {Covert channels are used for secret transfer of information. Encryption only protects communication from being decoded by unauthorized parties, whereas covert channels aim to hide the very existence of communication. This paper discusses a novel covert file transfer protocol (CFTP) based on the IP record route option. The CFTP protocol is used to secretly transfer text files and short messages between hosts. Firewalls that limit the outgoing traffic to a few allowed application protocols (e.g. FTP) can be circumvented by the CFTP protocol. To demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed covert protocol, a user friendly tool based on the client/server technology is implemented. Compared to related research, the main contribution in this work is that it introduces a new generation of covert channels. The proposed protocol is based on a novel session-oriented mechanism that offers TCP-like features embedded inside the IP option field. It provides more sophisticated communication tools that can be used for hiding information as well as synchronizing sessions and controlling the flow of exchanged data between hosts.},
	Annote = {- Covert channels are used for secret transfer of information. 
- Encryption only protects communication from being decoded by unauthorized parties, whereas covert channels aim to hide the very existence of communication.
- Covert channels in computer network protocols are similar to techniques for hiding information in audio, visual or textual content (steganography). 
- While steganography requires some form of content as cover, covert channels require some network protocols as carrier.
- The Internet Protocol (IP) is the most commonly used protocol in the network layer today, and is used for all traffic moving across the Internet.
- An IP header without options has a length of 20 bytes.
- However, an IP header with options may have a length of 60 bytes. 
- It is important to indicate that most IP packets do not use the Options field. 
- Therefore, a covert channel can use the unused 40 bytes of the Options field to carry hidden information in the IP packets.
- In its way to the destination, each router writes its IP address in the 4-byte-field pointed by the value in the Pointer field.
- Then, the value of the Pointer field in the IP header option is increased by 4. 
- Consequently, the next router would write its IP address in the next 4-byte-field. 
- However, if the value of the Pointer field becomes greater than the value of the Length field, then no more routers can write their IP addresses. 
- Therefore, we may establish a covert channel if the initial value of the Pointer field is greater than the value of the Length field, or just greater than the length of the hidden message. 
- Specifically, if we set the initial value of the Pointer field greater than the value of the Length field, then no router can write its IP address. 
- In this case, we can use all the remaining 36 bytes of the IP header option to insert a hidden message.},

	Annote = {- A covert channel is a communications channel which allows information to be transferred in a way that violates a security policy.
- An effective covert channel is undetectable by the adversay and can provide a string degree of privacy.
- Often the fact that secret communication is taking place between parties is undesirably revealing.
- Covert channels require many apparently contradictory properties.
- Plausibility: The adversary must believe that it is not only possible, but likely, that the user of the covert channel is using the medium in which the covert channel is found without sending covert data.
- Undetectability: In order for the channel to be undetectable, the distribution of bits sent must conform to the distribution of the channel itself, otherwise the channel with be able to be automatically detectable via statistical tests.
- Indispensability: The channel must be something which an adversary cannot or will not close off, usually due to the fact that it serves some useful function to the users which are not sending covert data.
- Many other channels have been identified in TCP. 
- These include initial sequence numbers, acknowledged sequence numbers, windowing bits and protocol identification.
- In order to send messages over this channel, we send one bit of our message block M per bit of the channel, rather than sending some function of multiple bits.
- This way, each bit of the data is independent and if one bit is lost or reordered it will not affect the sending of any of the other bits. 
- We choose which bit of the message block to send based on a keyed hash of the nonce. 
- That is, for a message block of size l and a key K, on the packet with nonce t we send bit number n where n = H(t,K) (mod l)
- The hash function H should be a cryptographic hash function which is collision-free and one-way.
- We can modify existing packets in two ways. 
- We can modify the application data or we can modify the protocol headers. 
- Modifying the application data requires a detailed understanding of the type of data sent by a wide variety of applications.},

The first kind arises from nontermination and the other from partial operations that can raise exceptions. The key idea is to limit the source of nontermination in the language to constructs with minimum typings, and to evaluate partial operations within expressions of try commands which also have minimum typings. A mutual progress theorem is proved that basically states that no two executions of a well-typed program can be distinguished on the basis of nontermination versus abnormal termination due to a partial operation. The proof uses a new style of programming language semantics which we call a natural transition semantics},

	Annote = {- Suppose that we want to assert that no information may flow from user A to user B via the system S. 
- We characterize this by asserting that B's view of S is unchanged by any alteration in A's behaviour.
- First, in real systems high-level input interferes with low-level output all the time. 
- High-level files can be encrypted, sanitized, or simply downgraded and sent on their way over low-level networks. 
- Second, after fifteen years of trying, we still don't have any consensus as to what is the ``correct'' nondeterministic formulation of it.
- Most ``real'' security policies are concerned with specifying who has access to what resources under what circumstances.
- The study of non-interference arose from the need to understand why covert channels were possible, at a time when the only theoretical security models were access-control models, which were unable to explain them.
- At the policy level, it has been suggested that no one cares about covert channels anymore, therefore models that purport to explain them are uninteresting.
- There is also the practical question of how noninterference theory can be translated into efficient algorithms for detecting covert channels. 
- Non-interference analysis is often implemented as a laborious verification effort, if it is implemented at all.
- At a more technical level, there is concern over the angels-on-a-pinhead syndrome. 
- In most non-interference models, a single bit of compromised information is flagged as a security violation, even if one bit is all that is lost.},

	Annote = {- Taking network protocols as carriers, covert channel has recently been widely applied for covert communication on networks. 
- Network covert channels hide the secret communication into normal network traffic to resist detection.
- There are many notable methods to design network covert channel in literature. 
- One important branch is to use packet length. 
- Padlipsky and Girling proposed to use the length of link layer frames directly. 
- Yao proposed another covert channel called LAWB based on the packet length. 
- Such covert channels based on packet length could enhance tamper resistance. 
- However, they are still vulnerable to detections due to the abnormal network traffic.
- In this paper, we propose a novel protocol-independent network covert channel based on message length. 
- In covert transmission, each message learns from the Reference to get the similar length distribution. 
- As such, the length distribution of our resulting messages is very similar to that of normal network messages.
- Packet length based methods are an important branch of covert channel design, for the reason that they could resist attacks that modify the fields of transmitting packets.
- Padlipsky and Girling proposed to modulate the length of link layer frames for secret message transmission.
- The secret message is made up of several bytes. 
- Each byte is represented by a certain frame length. 
- The method employs 256 different frame lengths to describe the bytes. 
- The receiver deduces the bytes of the secret message through the frames sending to him. 
- In this method, the secret message is usually encrypted, resulting in random bytes of message content, which leads to the random frame length distribution.
- Yao proposed another model based on packet length, named LAWB. 
- The sender and receiver share a secret matrix, with each cell representing a unique length. 
- Let us denote the byte of the secret message to be sent as i. 
- The sender randomly chooses an element len from the ith row of the secret matrix and sends out a packet of length len. 
- After receiving the packet, the receiver scans the matrix to locate which row the element len lies in, so as to get the byte i. 
- After sending several bytes of the secret message, the sender and receiver would do some matrix transformation simultaneously. 
- The above process is repeated until the whole secret message has been transmitted.
- Along with packet length based methods, there also exist some methods based on unused bits field and Initial Sequence Number (ISN).
- Then Alice and Bob would take the following five steps to transmit the secret message:
Step 1: Alice and Bob communicate normally. They both record the message lengths sent by Alice, and make the record as Reference.
Step 2: Alice and Bob select a length l from the Reference by the same random algorithm.
Step 3: In the ith sending, Alice sends to Bob a message of length lnext=l+SUMi. The Reference is updated by appending lnext.
Step 4: Bob decodes the ith message into Wi by subtracting l from lnext.
Step 5: Steps 2 to 4 are repeated until the whole secret message has been sent.
Notes:
(1) k, w and n are shared by Alice and Bob.
(2) Let max_L be the maximum message length in the initial Reference, then max_L>2w should be satisfied.
(3) In Step 3, if lnext < 0, lnext = lnext + max_L.},

- An access policy specifies the rights that subjects, such as users, have to access objects that contain information, such as files. 
- An information flow policy specifies the classes of information that can be contained in objects and the allowed relations between object classes.
- With respect to information flow, a program has three components:
(1) variables, which contain information;
(2) an information state, which consists of the current classification (i.e., degree of sensitivity) of each variable;
(3) statements, which modify variables (and hence alter the state) or control the order of execution.
- There are two types of information flow that can occur in sequential programs:
(1) direct flows resulting from assignment and IO statements;
(2) indirect flows resulting from conditional statements, such as if and while.
- A large number of both sequential and parallel programming constructs can be axiomatized.
- The effects of nonterminating programs can be handled. 
- The flow logic can be readily combined with correctness logic.
- This results from the elegance of the lattice model of secure information flow on which the flow logic is based.},

	Annote = {- This paper introduces a technique for detecting covert storage channels using a tree structure called a Covert Flow Tree (CFT). 
- The benefits of using Covert Flow Trees to perform a covert channel analysis are twofold. 
- First, by traversing the paths of a Covert Flow Tree, a comprehensive list of scenarios that potentially support covert communication via particular resource attributes can be automatically constructed. 
- Secondly, Covert Flow Trees graphically illustrate the process through which information regarding the state of one attribute is relayed to another attribute, and how in turn that information is relayed to a listening process.
- One finds that computer systems are built such that users are not limited to communicating only through the intended communication channels. 
- As a result, a well-founded concern of security-conscious system designers is the potential exploitation of system storage locations and timing facilities to provide unforeseen communication channels to users. 
- These illegitimate channels are known as covert storage and timing channels.
- Although there is concern that a user at a high security level may use a covert channel to signal information to a user at a lower level, the major threat from a covert channel is its potential to be employed by a Trojan horse.
- In addressing the threat of covert channels, two major challenges have been identified. 
- The first challenge is in developing techniques to identify covert channels in a comprehensive, systematic manner. 
- Several covert channel-analysis techniques have been proposed and utilized in recent years. Usually these techniques base their analysis either on code inspection or inspection of the high-level specification. 
- Among these techniques are the Non-Interference approach, the Shared Resource Matrix (SRM) methodology, and Information Flow analysis. 
- The second and more difficult challenge is in removing the channels or at least lowering their bandwidths without rendering the system unacceptably slow or restrictive.
- The goal of the CFT approach is to identify operation sequences that support either the direct or inferred recognition of a particular resource attribute. 
- The term recognition refers to a process' ability to detect when an attribute has been modified, and does not necessarily imply that the identification of the attribute's new value has occurred.
- The approach is novel in its use of a tree data structure, called a Covert Flow Tree, to systematically search for methods in which information can be signaled from one process to another via resource attributes. 
- An algorithm for automating the construction of CFT's was presented, along with a procedure which traverses the tree to automatically generate operation sequences that are potential covert channels.
- A prototype CFT graphical display tool was also discussed.
- One advantage in using this approach to perform a covert channel analysis is that it requires a minimum of information from a system specification.
- Another advantage of the CFT approach is the graphical illustration of the routes that information travels as it is relayed from attribute to attribute, and eventually detected by the receiver.
- A major concern with the CFT approach is the size of the Covert Flow Trees that are generated.
- Another area that deserves more research is determining which of the methods of reducing and expanding the operation sequences that were discussed, could be performed automatically by the CFT. 
- Currently, this is an ad-hoc process.},

- Even with the use of current technology, covert channel analysis is still largely an afterthought to trusted system design.
- A system is Separable (i.e. multilevel secure) iff it is behaviorally equivalent to a collection of single level systems that do not interact.
- A multilevel system is secure (i.e. is Asymmetrically, or Lattice Separable) iff it is behaviorally equivalent to a collection of single level systems interconnected entirely by one-way communication channels from lower to higher security levels.
- When Mode Security is applicable to an engineering problem, the bulk of covert channel analysis can be started and finished entirely within the preliminary design period of the system.
- Engineers could even use modeling and simulation to study performance trade offs of different choices of modes, mode change schemes and frequencies.
- The author is hopeful that while Mode Security may not universally apply to secure systems, that a useful class of systems can be found that do lend themselves to Mode Secure architectures.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an approach to detect illegal information flows from requirements expressed as high-level scenarios.},
	Annote = {- The term covert channel has been first introduced to designate an information flow that violates the security policy of a system. 
- Covert channels are considered as a threat to information systems, as they can be used to provide information leaks, synchronize attacks of a system, or divert a system from its initial use. 
- Their detection is considered as an important task that should be automated as much as possible, in order to be reproducible.
- It is generally admitted that covert channels cannot be completely eliminated.
- Several automatic techniques have been proposed to detect covert channels in information systems.
- They are based on an abstract representation of a system by a model.
- The approach proposed in this paper is to perform covert channels analysis for distributed systems at the requirement level, when design decision can still be taken to reduce the bandwidth of a channel at reasonable cost. 
- The research is based on a representation of requirements by scenarios.
- We have to make several assertions to check if illegal information can flow from a sender S to a receiver R. 
- The first assumption is that S and R agree on a protocol for sending and receiving covert information.
- Covert messages can be of arbitrary length, and we suppose that the same functionality of the diverted protocol is used an arbitrary number of times.
- Decoding can be performed if and only if one can nd a function mapping the message received by R to a sequence of integers (the choices of S). 
- A first sufficient condition is to require the words read by instance R to form a code. 
- However, this condition is not always necessary: decoding can be performed, in more cases, by a transducer producing an integer sequence from received messages.
- The main advantages of this technique is that it provides immediately an user with scenarios for using a potential covert channel, and a decoder for covert messages, given as a transducer.
- This paper has only considered a coding and transmission strategy using a single choice node.},

We propose to provide quantifiable security, acceptable reliability, and minimal performance penalties by interposing a device (called the Pump) to push messages to the high system and provide a controlled stream of acknowledgements to the low system. This paper describes how the Pump supports the transmission of messages upward and limits the capacity of the covert timing channel in the acknowledgement stream without affecting the average acknowledgement delay seen by the low system or the message delivery delay seen by the high system in the absence of actual Trojan horses. By adding random delays to the acknowledgment stream, we show how to further reduce the covert channel capacity even in the presence of cooperating Trojan horses in both the high and low systems. We also discuss engineering trade-offs relevant to practical use of the Pump.},

- The Pump supports the transmission of messages upward and limits the capacity of the covert timing channel in the acknowledgement stream without affecting the average acknowledgeent delay seen by the low system or the message delivery delay seen by the high system in the absence of an actual Trojan horse.
- Sharing information between different security levels is quite cumbersom in this kind of system, which impedes high speed data transfer.
- Multilevel secure (MLS) systems promise to ease this problem.
- Unfortunately, the security constraints in MLS systems often damge overall performance.
- We propose to add non-uniform random noise to response time to permit a high degree of security, while maintaining efficient performance standards.
- Read-down allows the high levle user to read the low level user's memory; but it does not allow the high level user to send signals after it reads the low level user's message.
- Blind write-up allows the low low level user to write on the high level user's memory; but it does not allow the high level user to send an acknowledgement to the low level user.
- The Pump adds random noise to conventionalcommunication methods to reduce covert channel capacity
- This approach is different from others in the sense that it pays almost no performance penalty in the benign situation.

- The system is multilevel secure if users have access only to information classified at or below their clearance. In a distributed framework, multilevel security can be achieved by using trusted secure components, called Multilevel Secure Components (MSCs), to connect single-level systems bounded at different security levels, thus creating a multiple single-level security architecture.
- An MSC proposal is the Naval Research Laboratory's Pump (NRL Pump). 
- It lets information pass from a low level system to one at a higher level.
- Now, acks are needed for reliable communication. If the high system passed acks directly to the low one, then it could pass high information by altering ack delays. 
- To minimize such covert channel, the pump decouples the acks stream by inserting random delays. 
- To avoid time performance degradation, the long-term high-system-to-pump time behavior should be reflected in the long-term pump-to-low-system time behavior.
- It is admitted that this method cannot handle a large state space

	Address = {Taipei, Taiwan},
	Annote = {- Covert channels are illicit means of leaking sensitive or private information through system global variables that usually are not part of the interpretation of data objects in the security model.
- Covert channels present a serious risk to data security in computer systems and networks.
- As more and more systems link to one another through networks, security risks increase exponentially. 
- It is, thus, essential for any multilevel secure operating systems and their applications to use formal methods of covert channel analysis for a trusted computing base. 
- A trusted computing base (TCB) is the part of the machine hardware and system software of a secure system that enforces the security policy of the model in the system and whose correctness must be verified.
- Covert channels can be classified into two types: storage channels and timing channels. 
- Although fundamentally the same, storage channels and timing channels differ in the way that information is encoded.
- A guideline including those requirements states that covert channels of less than one bit per second are usually considered acceptable while a rate of more than 100 bits per second is considered unacceptable.
- Tsai and Gligor presented a Markov model to simulate the use of covert storage channels and to compute their maximum bandwidths under different system loads and program behaviors. 
- The model was developed based on the assumption that the distributions of zeros and ones are equal because the maximum capacity of a symmetric discrete memoryless channel is achieved using input (0's and 1's) with equal probability. 
- When its transition times are approximately equal, it is reasonable for the finite-state channel to have uniform transition times, which are equal to the mean of its transition times. 
- Thus, the effort required for estimation can be reduced.
- In other cases where the difference between the time required to transmitting a bit of zero and that required for a bit of one through a covert channel is significant, the above assumption becomes inadequate. 
- Other coding techniques has been proposed in an attempt to solve problem. 
- In 1964, Shannon proposed a technique for computing the capacity of finite-state communication channels with non-uniform transition times. 
- Millen adapted this technique to finite-state covert channels that use individual channel variables. 
- However, analysis on individual channel variables is not sufficient because (1) many channel variables are dependent, and (2) some channels cannot be modeled as finite-state channels
- Kemmerer pointed out that the minimum conditions for the existence of a storage channel are as follows: (1) there must exist a global variable in the system to which both the sending and the receiving processes have access; (2) there must be a way (usually by invoking system calls) in which the sending process can alter the value of the global variable, and the receiving process can detect or observe (view) any change in the global variable; and (3) there must be a way in which the sending and the receiving processes can synchronize their operations so that the events of information flow can happen.
- The earliest work on covert-channel analysis of source code was that of Tsai, Gligor and Chandersekaran.
- There is a potential covert channel between two subjects of a secure system if and only if (1) the two subjects have the potential to communicate with each other in the system and (2) such communication between the two corresponding subjects in the security model is not allowed under the non-discretionary security policy.
- The reasons why a potential covert channel may not necessarily be a real covert channel are that: (1) covert-channel analysis is usually performed statically and syntactically based on design specifications and implementation, and not dynamically at the time when the channel is actually being used; (2) in general, every covert channel has a condition associated with it which enables or disables information flows through the channel; and (3) real-time operation of the system may never make the condition become true and, thus, will never enable the channel of information flows.
- There are basically two classes of covert storage channels: resource exhaustion and event count. 
- Resource-exhaustion channels exist wherever system resources are shared among users at more than one security level. 
- To use a resource-exhaustion channel, the sending process decides to exhaust or not exhaust a system resource, such as disk space, to encode a bit of 0 or 1.
- In event-count channels, the sending process encodes multiple bits by requesting or not requesting a shared system resource (but not exhausting the resource).
- Some covert channels can be modeled as finite-state graphs, while others cannot. 
- We call channels that cannot be modeled as finite-state graphs infinite-state channels.},

	Annote = {- Several types of statistical covert channels that break the informational system security policy ensuring a reliable information transfer between hostile agents can be detected by a competent warden.
- Some methods proposed can be used as well for analysis of steganography methods or covert channels. 
- We assume that such covert channels will exploit for secure transmission a manipulation of the probability distribution parameters of the sent message sequence.
- We analyze the system with infinite sequences of messages and show that the final results of analysis are almost independent of the probability model.
- Intrusion detection demands the quickest reaction to an attack. 
- That means that the decision should be based on the shortest trace of entrance data.
- Warden can permit covert transmission to get enough information for proving covert channel existence (data hiding). 
- Warden's problem consists of knowledge absence about a data hiding method. 
- That means that he knows hypothesis H0 but doesn't know alternatives.
- The obtained results show that the manipulation of the probability distribution of the messages in communicational link in order to send hidden messages can be revealed. 
- The warden should know well enough the normal properties of the communication link and its probabilistic characteristics, e.g. in lemma 1'. 
- Then it is possible to construct a consistent test for detection of hidden message.},

We then define a security automaton for this extended mechanism and show a class of properties which is enforced by the security automaton. Further, our mechanism can enforce information flow policies, which are specified by system developers, under an information flow property to be defined for the aim of this study.

- If they can call operators running on trusted computing base (TCB), using a shared storage similar to Upgraded Directory, then a covert channel is involved between them, Upgraded Directory is a way to make enrolling easy. 
- Lucy create a upgraded directory in a level of Holly and Holly create or remove a file in the directory. 
- Whenever Lucy try to remove the directory, the remove operator return a result in successful or unsuccessful. 
- Using the result, Lucy is able to obtain one bit, 0 or 1, from Holly.
- Information flow policies will be defined as relations between groups of users on a system. The relations signify a
direction that the system allows to flow. In the above example, the policy allow Lucy to transfer information for Holly, written in Lucy ~> Holly.

	Annote = {- Digital audio, video, and pictures are increasingly furnished with distinguishing but imperceptible marks, which may contain a hidden copyright notice or serial number or even help to prevent unauthorised copying directly. 
- Military communications systems make increasing use of trac security techniques which, rather than merely concealing the content of a message using encryption, seek to conceal its sender, its receiver or its very existence.
- The embedded data is the message that one wishes to send secretly. 
- It is usually hidden in an innocuous message referred to as a cover-text, or cover-image or cover-audio as appropriate, producing the stego-text or other stego-object.
- Security Through Obscurity: By the 16-17th centuries, there had arisen a large literature on steganography and many of the methods depended on novel means of encoding information.
- Camouflage: The situation may be improved by intelligent use of camouflage. Even if the method is known in principle, making the hidden data expensive to look for can be beneficial, especially where there is a large amount of cover traffic.
- Hiding the location of the embedded information: In a security protocol developed in ancient China, the sender and the receiver had copies of a paper mask with a number of holes cut at random locations. The sender would place his mask over a sheet of paper, write the secret message into the holes, remove the mask and then compose a cover message incorporating the code ideograms. The receiver could read the secret message at once by placing his mask over the resulting letter.
- Spreading the hidden information:  The obvious solution is to consider filtering operations as the introduction of noise in the embedded data channel and to use suitable coding techniques to exploit the residual bandwidth.
- Techniques specific to the environment: Echo hiding leads naturally to the broader topic of information hiding techniques that exploit features of a particular application environment.
- Also important are covert channels: communication paths that were neither designed nor intended to transfer information at all. 
- Common examples include timing variations and error messages in communication protocols and operating system call interfaces. 
- Covert channels are of particular concern in the design and evaluation of mandatory access control security concepts, where the operating system attempts to restrict the flow of information between processes in order to protect the user from computer viruses and Trojan horse software that transmits secrets to third parties without authorization.},

This article provides an overview of the existing techniques for creating covert channels in widely deployed network protocols, and common methods for their detection, elimination, and capacity limitation.},

	Annote = {- Covert channels are used for the secret transfer of information. 
- Encryption only protects communication from being decoded by unauthorized parties, whereas covert channels aim to hide the very existence of the communication.
- The huge amount of data and large number of different protocols in the Internet is ideal as a high-bandwidth vehicle for covert communication.
- Typically, covert channels use means of communication not normally intended to be used for communication, making them quite elusive.
- Lampson introduced covert channels in 1973 in the context of monolithic systems as a mechanism by which a process at a high security level leaks information to a process at a low security level that would otherwise not have access to it.
- Covert channels in computer network protocols are similar to steganography, the hiding of information in audio, visual, or textual content.
- While steganography requires some form of content as cover, covert channels require some network protocol as carrier. 
- The ubiquitous presence of a small number of network protocols suitable as carriers (e.g., Internet Protocol) make covert channels widely available. 
- They are usable even in situations where steganography cannot be applied.
- Many applications of covert channels are of a malicious or unwanted nature, and therefore pose a serious threat to network security. 
- Furthermore, it is likely that because of increased measures against open channels, such as the free transfer of memory sticks in and out of organizations, the use of covert channels in computer networks will increase. 
- Understanding existing covert channel techniques is crucial in developing countermeasures.
- A diverse range of individuals and groups has found reason to utilize covert channels for communication and coordination. 
- Typically this is motivated by the existence of an adversarial relationship between two parties (e.g., government agencies vs. criminal or terrorist organizations, hackers or corporate spies vs. a company IT department, or dissenting citizens vs. their governments).
- Computer viruses or worms can use covert channels to spread themselves undetected or covertly exchange information necessary for distributed processing.
- Network administrators can use covert channels to secure network management related communication by hiding it from hackers.
- Often even ordinary employees may want to use covert channels to simply bypass their company firewalls in order to access Internet resources.
- Storage channels involve the direct/indirect writing of object values by the sender and the direct/indirect reading of the object values by the receiver.
- Timing channels involve the sender signaling information by modulating the use of resources (e.g., CPU usage) over time such that the receiver can observe it and decode the information.
- Provides examples of covert channels in network protocols using: unsed header bits, optional header fields, semantic overloading of header fields, modulating header fields, packet and message sequence timing, packet and header field ordering, collisions, loss, and retransmissions, indirect channels, and payload tunneling.
- Before any action can be taken against a covert channel, it needs to be identified. 
- The identification of a covert channel can be ad hoc or based on a formal method. 
- A number of formal methods have been developed for identifying covert channels in single host systems.
- The few proposed formal techniques for identifying covert channels in network protocols are mostly based on an adaptation of one of these techniques.
- There are two causes of covert channels: design oversights and weaknesses inherent in the system design.

	Annote = {- Data hiding has been with us as long as there have been digital computers and networks.
- Remember data hiding on tracks above 80 of the ubiquitous 5-1/4-inch double-sided, double-density floppy disks in the late 1970s.
- There are two popular covert channeling techniques, protocol bending and packet crafting.
- Protocol bending involves the use of a network protocol for some unintended purpose. 
- Typically, this involves embedding data in TCP/IP packets in unexpected places (akin to the higherlevel tracks in the floppy disk example). 
- A time-worn tactic is covert channeling over Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets, for example, by using the ICMP options field in each packet to convey applications-layer covert data.
- Most firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems don't inspect ICMP packets.
- This is where the protocol is `bent,' which results in the establishment of a covert channel between network endpoints that lies under the radar of any network administration tool that assumes that ICMP packets will all conform to IETF specifications.
- Perhaps the most widely known ICMP covert channel tool is Loki.
- Another popular protocol bender is Reverse WWW Shell, which uses a form of protocol bending called shell shoveling over HTTP.
- Contrasted with protocol benders are covert channeling tools that use packet crafting to embed data in the actual packet headers themselves. 
- Covert_TCP and NUSHU are two such examples.
- Covert data may be thought of as a small subset of dark data.
- There are many categories of covert data. 
- Encryption produces dark data in the sense that while the existence of the data isn't hidden, its content is only readable and usable to those who have the correct decryption key. 
- Steganography produces dark data that is typically buried within light data (for example, a non-perceptible digital watermark buried within a digital photograph).
- The physical structure consists of disks, cylinders, tracks, clusters, and sectors. 
- The absence of 1:1 mappings between the logical and the physical realms creates the digital warrens for concealed data.
- More frightening, however, is that modern computer forensics tools are not designed to uncover all digital warrens. 
- They typically focus on those disk areas that have already been observed to hold concealed data. 
- This presents a major problem for law enforcement, because the more sophisticated hacker, criminal, or terrorist could take advantage of the disk warrens that are not easily found by current forensics tools. 
- So, from a security and forensics point of view it is wise to approach the problem of data hiding from the point of view of
what's possible rather than what's already known.
- Without question, the most frightening side effect of these digital warrens is the inability of modern forensic tools to easily recover the data.
- Most of the forensics work in law enforcement that I'm aware of involves very basic data recovery techniques with a few popular forensics tools.
- A mainstay of modern forensics tools is a file carver.
- It isn't a question of whether covert data is being hidden on hard drives of unsuspecting users, but what is being hidden and for what purposes.
- To make matters worse, antiforensic tools have been developed that are becoming as sophisticated as the forensics tools they seek to defeat.
- The importance of this burgeoning art of anti-forensics can not be overstated. Imagine the impact on law enforcement if fingerprint evidence was unreliable and iris scans could be easily spoofed.},

	Abstract = {Covert channels are information leaks in systems that use resources to transfer secretly a message. They are a threat for security, performance, but also for a system's profitability. This paper proposes a new approach to detect covert channels from scenario models of protocols. The problem of finding covert channels in scenarios is first modeled as a game, in which a pair of malicious users {S,R} is trying to transfer information while the rest of the protocol tries to prevent it. The messages transferred are encoded by behavioral choices at some precise moments, and decoded by a transducer whose input vocabulary is an observation of the system. We then characterize the presence of a covert channel as the existence of a winning strategy for {S,R} and of a decoder.},
	Annote = {- Covert channels are information leaks in systems that use resources to transfer secretly a message. 
- They are a threat for security, performance, but also for a system's profitability.
- A covert channel is an information flow that violates a system's security policy. 
- Covert channels are considered as a threat for information systems, for several reasons. 
- The first obvious reason is of course a security issue, as covert channels can be used to pass information secretly. 
- Covert channels can also be an economical threat. They can be used to transmit information (very often at a low rate) using an existing system without paying for the service provided. 
- Furthermore, they are often based on an obfuscated use of resources or functionalities, which heavily impacts the performances of a system.
- A storage channel is a channel that uses a resource of a system to write information that can be read by a third party. 
- A timing channel is a channel that modifies a system's response time in a way that can be observed by a third party. 
- It is recommended to systematically try to detect covert channel with formal techniques. 
- When a covert channel is discovered, it is then required to document it with scenarios of use, and to compute its bandwidth. 
- It is generally admitted that closing all covert channels is impossible. 
- Very often closing means suppressing accesses to all resources used for information passing.
- The confinement notion in information systems defines for each user the services he can access and the users he is allowed to communicate with. 
- Covert channels can be used to transfer information outside this confinement zone. - Several approaches to detect indirect information flows have been proposed: shared resources matrices, axiomatic approaches... 
- More recently, the existence of covert channels has been defined through non interference properties.
- Non-interference is also questioned as the transfer of a single bit of information causes a non-interference violation
- Several approaches to non-interference have been proposed, through typing (a system contains an interference if it cannot be correctly typed), or using process algebra.
- Very often, non-interference approaches classify data and processes of a system according to two security levels, high and low. High-level processes can access any data in the system and communicate with all other high processes, while low-level processes are not allowed to read information from the high level, either directly or indirectly.
- Illegal information flows may exist over legal information transfers. 
- This kind of covert channel is often called ``legitimate channel''. 
- A classical example is watermarking: it is possible to add covert information to a legal information flow just by altering some bits. 
- However, the search for covert channels does not usually address the contents of legal data, which is more a steganography problem. Another possibility is to hide data in some useless parts of protocol frames to pass covert information in a legal data flow.
- This kind of covert channel is frequent, but can be easily detected and closed. 
- Another possibility in protocols is to use the way information is passed from a participant to another to encode information.
- Protocol-based covert channels detection addresses the problem of illegal information flow in a less generic way than non-interference, as it makes an initial assumption on how data is encoded.
- Using scenarios has several advantages.
- First, scenarios are often the first information one can obtain about a system's behavior. 
- They are also used to describe systems requirements. Detecting covert channels at early stages of a system's development can help modifying the systems when modifications can still be done at reasonable cost. 
- A second reason for the use of scenarios is that several recommendations ask to document covert channels use with such models. 
- Studying covert channels directly from scenarios provides immediately examples to document an illegal information flow.
- Scenarios are good candidates to capture most common behaviors of a system.
- It may be argued that scenarios model only a part of a system, and hence may miss some illegal flows.
- It is generally admitted that a gap always exists between a model and its implementation.
- This scenario based approach has the same drawback, and only reveals ``potential covert channels'', the existence of which should be tested on a real implementation of a protocol.
- The approach proposed is to start from a scenario description of a system. 
- From this description, a covert channel is modeled as a game in which a pair of corrupted users {S,R} try to send information while the rest of the protocol is trying to prevent this information flow. 
- A covert channel exists if {S,R} has a winning strategy in the game, and if R can decode the message that is transmitted with 
a transducer built from the strategy.},

	Annote = {- The concept of covert channel communication was first introduced by Lampson in 1973
- We want to be able to confine an arbitrary program. This does not mean that any program which works when free will still work under confinement, but that any program, if confined, will be unable to leak data.
- We begin by observing that a confined program must be memoryless. In other words, it must not be able to preserve information within itself from one call to another.
- Total isolation: A confined program shall make no calls on any other program.
- Transitivity: If a confined program calls another program which is not trusted, the called program must also be confined.
- A trustworthy program must guard against any possible leakage of data.
- Storage of various kinds maintained by the supervisor which can be written by the service and read by an unconfined program, either shortly after it is written or at some later time.
- Legitimate channels used by the confined service, such as the bill.
- Covert channels, i.e. those not intended for information transfer at all, such as the service program's effect on the system load.
- The following simple principle is sufficient to block all legitimate and covert channels.
- Masking: A program to be confined must allow its caller to determine all its inputs into legitimate and covert channels. We say that the channels are masked by the caller.
- Enforcement: The supervisor must ensure that a confined program's input to covert channels conforms to the caller's specifications.},

A methodology for discovering storage and timing channels that can be used through all phases of the software life cycle to increase confidence that all channels have been identified is presented. The methodology is presented and applied to an example system with three different descriptions: English, formal specification, and high-order language implementation},
	Annote = {- Overt channels use the system's protected data objects to transfer information.
- Covert channels, in contrast, use entities not normally viewed as data objects to transfer information from one subject to another.
- These nondata objects, such as file locks, device busy flags, and the passing of time, are needed to register the state of the system.
- The use of a storage or timing channel requires collusion between a subject with authorization to signal or leak information and an unauthorized subject. 
- Note that the subject with authorization could be a malicious program acting without the knowledge of the user.
- Methods for discovering these channels have for the most part been ad hoc, giving little assurance that all storage and timing channels have indeed been discovered.
- All shared resources that can be referenced or modified by a subject are enumerated, and then each resource is carefully examined to determine whether it can be used to transfer information from one subject to another covertly. 
- The methodology assumes that the subjects of the system are processes and that there is a single processor which is shared by all of the processes. 
- The processes may be local or distributed; however, only one process may be active at any one time.
- To determine which shared resources can be modified or referenced one must first identify the shared resources. 
- A shared resource is any object or collection of objects that may be referenced or modified by more than one process.
- Attributes of all shared resources are indicated in row headings of the shared resource matrix.
- Next, one must determine all operation primitives of the system being analyzed.
- After determining all of the row and column headings one must determine for each attribute (the row headings) whether the primitive indicated by the column heading modifies or references that attribute.

We describe a technique for analyzing the capacity of counting channels and use our technique to analyze a known counting channel (viz, the bus contention channel) under two different types of countermeasures: an existing countermeasure called fuzzy time and a novel countermeasure called probabilistic partitioning. In particular, our analysis provides the only known upper bound on the capacity of the bus contention channel under fuzzy time. Also, for both types of countermeasures, we obtain precise tradeoffs between covert channel capacity and other desirable system properties.},
	Annote = {- Many organizations have a need for computer systems that store, process, and provide access to data that is classified with respect to a multilevel heirarchy (e.g., unclassified, cofidential, secret, top secret, etc.)
- This paper refers to two levels, "high" and "low" with the understanding that the high level strictly dominates the low level. i.e., low level users are not cleared to see high level data.
- Thre is no precise distinction between a covert channel and a normal communication channel; but typically, a channel is called "covert" if it is (1) hidden from authorities or (2) capable of violationf the intended security policy.
- Note that the threat that we are concerned with is not that the users (i.e., the human users) of the high processes are attempting to send information to low users.
- For if they wanted to, they could more easily pass notes in the park and entirely bypass the computer system.
- Rather, we are concerned that the high process is actually a Trojan Horse (i.e., a program that appears to be something that the users want, but actually contains something else that is entirely undesireable) and that the Trojan Horse is attempting to send high information to the low process.
- Generally speaking, whenever there is a shared resouce, there is the potential for a covert channel.
- The only way to completely prevent communication over a shared resource is to remove all contention (between security levels) for that resource.
- This leads to inefficient utilization of resources.
- Thus, as long as we want to share resources in an efficient manner, we will have covert channels.
- A storage channel is one where the high process signals by modulating the value of some storage variable that can be (indirectly) read by the low process; the information being sent over the channel is encoded in the value of the storage variable.
- A timing channel is one where the high process signlalsby modulating the timing of an event that is visible for the low process; the information being sent is encoded in the time it takes for an event to occur.
- This distinction is not entirely precise, but the important thing to note is that in order to exploit a timing channel, the low recieveing process needs a reference clock against which it can measure the timing of events.
- The advantages of the two contermeasures introduced in this paper are summarized.},

	Abstract = {Traditional covert channels study mainly focus on digital signature, operation system and multimedia technology. The covert channels in TCP/IP protocol suite have many advantages, such as they are harder to be detected and more robust. Two covert channels are discovered by using FTP protocol command sequence based on the study of FTP protocol. The principles of covert channels are analyzed. Three characters of covert channels, which are concealment, bandwidth and robustness, are studied. And the methods to construct covert channels are also applicable to other internet protocol.},
	Annote = {- The TCP/IP covert channels are implemented by utilizing reserved or redundant bits in TCP/IP header
- The TCP/IP packets are created and deleted dynamically, which means they are not stored in the network for a long time. Therefore it is hard for the attacker to collect all the packets, which carry the hiding information, to get the covert information correctly.
- TCP/IP communication is very common today. Every two computers may have TCP/IP traffic with each other, which makes it securer than traditional covert channels. The channel has good concealment character.
- The megabit switch local area network is the mainstream today and gigabit network may evolve in near future. The backbone network has tens of gigabit per second bandwidth now. The TCP/IP covert channels bandwidths are very rich.
- The packets, which carry covert information, can transfer through various routes due to the distribution of the TCP/IP network and dynamic route protocol update. It is harder to the attacker to get the whole covert carries in such highly distributed environment.
- The authentication information can be embedded into the TCP/IP covert channels to make the authentication implicit, which will not arouse the attackers attention.
- There are hundreds of application protocols using TCP/IP protocol as the carrier. Every applications implementation is complicated. These two factors make the covert channels based on TCP/IP application protocol even harder to be detected than others.
- FTP is a TCP/IP application protocol, which implements the file transfers function
- The current research on TCP/IP covert channels mainly uses IP, TCP, UDP header or ICMP payload as the covert information carrier
- IP identification field covert channel. The length of IP identification field is 16 bits. A byte of covert information can be embedded into the high order 8 bits of identification field and the low order 8 bits are set randomly to avoid producing same values.
- TCP initial sequence number covert channel. The ISN of TCP is 32 bits, which can transmit 32 bits covert information in one TCP connection.
- TCP source address covert channels. Every IP packet has a 32 bits source address field, which can carry 32 bits covert information.
- ICMP echo request/reply covert channel. The payload length of the ICMP packet is various, which can carry a number of information.
- In file transfer protocol, clients and servers exchange commands and responses to control the file transfer. Every command can be encoded into a bit-string. But in rfc959, the commands are encoded into ASCII format. So, we can build a new commands encoding algorithm, which can use the commands to encode the covert information.
- We select a command space Q, which is a set of FTP commands. Every command in the Q can be encoded by a fix length of bits. Suppose the size of Q is N, which means there are N commands in the Q.
- The common used FTP client software integrates a function called idle prevention scheme, which guarantees at least one command will be sent in a fixed period of time.
- The covert channels based on FTP command sequence are based on the idle prevention schemes. To illustrate the principal of covert channel, we suppose three commands such as NOOP, ABOR and ALLO are selected in idle prevention function and can be sent at will by the user.
- The covert channels use a special sequence of these commands to encode a fix length of covert information. In FTP implementation, these commands needed be sent at random to keep the control connections from idle condition.
- The covert channel utilizes the number of sent NOOP commands to encode a byte of the covert information. To transmit a byte of covert information, the number range of sent commands is from zero to 255. Before a byte of covert information is transmitted, an ABOR command needs to be sent to represent the beginning of next byte of covert information.
- The covert channel utilizes NOOP, ABOR and ALLO commands sequence to perform hierarchical encoding. Divide N bits covert information into two parts: high order M bits and next low order N-M bits. The high order M bits are encoded with the number of ALLO commands sent; the next N-M bits are encoded with the number of NOOP commands sent.},

	Abstract = {Covert channels have been topic of discussion within both academic and non-academic communities for more than two decades now. Tradi- tionally, research on this topic focussed on storage and timing channels within singular systems. As more systems became interconnected in the last decade, the scope expanded to network-based covert channels. Nu- merous designs and implementations of such covert channels have been suggested, altogether leaving the world with valuable pieces of knowledge scattered around the Internet. By aggregating the essentials and repre- senting them in a structured format, we attempt to provide clarity on the current state of research. In addition, a (non-exhaustive) overview of con- temporary trends in network-based covert channels is given, explaining common channels within IP, TCP, ICMP, HTTP and DNS. Lastly, sev- eral implementations were evaluated to gain insight in their efficiency and performance, and the influences to which they're prone. We conclude that they pose a security issue that needs proper attention when defining and enforcing security policies, and expect more sophisticated covert channels to appear in the future.},

- A covert channel is a communication channel that allows a process to transfer information in a manner that violates the system's security policy
- The typical scenario for the covert channels discussed in this paper is shown in figure 1
- value-based spatial channel:  encodes data within a spatial container. Example: covertly communicating the letter `A' by using it's 32-bit representation from a Unicode character set as a TCP Initial Sequence Number.
- transition-based spatial channel: encodes data by representing it as changes between spatial containers, therefore using at least N+1 spatial containers to encode N characters. Example: covertly communicating the letter `A' by crafting one TCP packet with the source port set to `1234', waiting, and then crafting a second TCP packet with it's source port set to `6464' (the transition from `1234' to '6464' would represent the character `A').
- value-based temporal channel: encodes data by modulating the occurrence of events (time dimension). Example: using network packet arrival times to implement a binary channel.
- transition-based temporal channel: encodes data by modulating intermediate delays on the occurrence of events, therefore using N + 1 events to encode N characters. Example: using network interpacket arrival times (jitter) to implement a binary channel.

	Abstract = {Analyzing information flow is beneficial for ensuring the satisfiability of security policies during the exchange of information between the agents of a system. In the literature, models such as Bell-LaPadula model and the Chinese Wall model are proposed to capture and govern the exchange of information among agents. Also, we find several verification techniques for analyzing information flow within programs or multi-agent systems. However, these models and techniques assume the atomicity of the exchanged information, which means that the information cannot be decomposed or combined with other pieces of information. Also, the policies of their models prohibit any transfer of information from a high level agent to a low level agent. In this paper, we propose a technique that relaxes these assumptions. Indeed, the proposed technique allows classifying information into frames and articulating finer granularity policies that involve information, its elements, or its frames. Also, it allows for information manipulation through several operations such as focusing and combining information. Relaxing the atomicity of information assumption permits an analysis that takes into account the ability of an agent to link elements of information in order to evolve its knowledge.  The technique uses global calculus to specify the communication between agents, information algebra to represent agent knowledge, and an amended version of Hoare logic to verify the satisfiability of policies.   },
